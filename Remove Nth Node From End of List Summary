Solution summary
Two pointers, right and left, are set at the head node.
Move the right pointer n steps forward.
If right reaches NULL, return head's next node.
Move both right and left pointers forward till right reaches the last node.
Relink the left node to the node at left's next to the next node.
Return head.

Time complexity
The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

Space complexity
The space complexity is O(1) because we use constant space to store two pointers.
